<p>Welcome to the IndiaFOSS Handbook! This documentation aims to provide comprehensive resources and guidance for IndiaFOSS organisers and volunteers.</p>
<p>IndiaFOSS is an annual Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) conference organised by the FOSS United community. It is a celebration of software innovation and the people who make it happen. The FOSS United community has been organising IndiaFOSS since 2020 every year in Bengaluru.</p>

<p><a href="https://fossunited.org/indiafoss/2024">IndiaFOSS 2024</a></p>
<p>This purpose of this handbook is to familiarize everyone with all that happens behind the scenes at the conference. All the volunteers and organizers are encourage to go through this documentation and update it whenever necessary.</p>
<p>The event happens tentatively in September-October every year at NIMHANS convention center, Bengaluru. As of last year, we saw 1600+ registrations (and 1300+ attendees in person), 44 talks, 7 workshops, 8 BoF sessions and 14 on spot lightning talks at the conference.</p>
<p>The event has a unconference flair to it which offers attendees to either participate in the typical conference setup with talks happening in auditoriums (3) or be a part of the various activities that happen parallely. This includes project expos, Birds of a Feather Sessions, Open Spaces, Lightning Talks etc.</p>

<p>[This page is an update to the <a href="https://forum.fossunited.org/t/volunteering-for-foss-united-conferences/3159">Volunteering at FOSS United conferences</a> post. ]</p>
<p>IndiaFOSS at its core is a volunteer driven event. Every year, active members from the FOSS United community, city chapters and student clubs come together to organise the conference.</p>
<p>All volunteers are assigned specific workgroups in which they can contribute. Volunteers are onboarded in 2 phases, typically pre-event remove volunteering activities and during-event on ground activities.</p>
<h3 id="expectations"><a class="header" href="#expectations">Expectations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We expect the volunteers to have a basic understanding of our vision of promoting FOSS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to put in <strong>3-4 hours</strong> a week; this might slightly increase for some workgroups as we get closer to the event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be consistent</strong> with the deliverables expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform the team about any other commitments you may have, or if you will be unavailable for a certain period of time beforehand.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>Over time, we have realised that a fundamental change is required in community partnerships for IndiaFOSS. The conference is now "popular" enough that we don't require communities to post about the event regularly. Instead, the goal of community partnerships is now to give a platform to small communities that resonate with our philosophy, and to encourage them to talk about their initiatives.</p>

<p>The community partnerships team plays a key role in fostering relationships with diverse tech communities. Our aim is to provide meaningful support, ensuring that these communities benefit from their collaboration with IndiaFOSS.</p>
<p>For IndiaFOSS 2024, instead of expecting communities to regularly promote the event, we focused on offering a platform to communities that align with our values. The new objective was to give them the opportunity to showcase their initiatives/projects/demos and amplify their voices within the open-source ecosystem.</p>
<p>Partnerships involve continuous communication with community leaders/representatives to ensure they have the tools and information needed to collaborate effectively. This includes helping them engage with IndiaFOSS, facilitating joint efforts, and providing visibility to their initiatives.</p>
<p>During the conference, the community partnerships team also ensures that partners are well-supported and feel involved as a part of family.</p>
<h2 id="things-to-keep-in-mind"><a class="header" href="#things-to-keep-in-mind">Things to Keep in Mind:</a></h2>
<p><strong>Effective Communication:</strong> Maintain clear and consistent communication with partners.
<strong>Supportive Role:</strong> Ensure each community partner feels encouraged and valued throughout their involvement.
<strong>Teamwork:</strong> Collaborate with other teams to align partnership goals with the broader event strategy.</p>
<h2 id="responsibilities"><a class="header" href="#responsibilities">Responsibilities:</a></h2>
<p>Keep community partners informed about the event and collaboration opportunities.
Address any queries or concerns partners might have regarding their role.
Help ensure a smooth collaboration between community partners and the event team.</p>
<p><strong>Things for Next Year, maybe?</strong></p>
<p>For future editions, rather than just asking community partners to share social posts of IndiaFOSS, spreading more awareness about FOSS United's philosophy and how the foundation operates can be a priority. A potential initiative could be designing an informative poster about the foundation’s philosophy, which community partners can share within their networks. This will help raise awareness about FOSS United and create a coordinated marketing effort for both IndiaFOSS and the foundation.</p>

<h2 id="team-and-maintaining-effective-communication"><a class="header" href="#team-and-maintaining-effective-communication">Team and maintaining effective communication</a></h2>
<p>A dedicated and communicative team. Each member should be comfortable with sending multiple emails, making follow-ups, and keeping the conversation flowing within the team and potential speakers, Diversity Scholars (for diversity scholarship), and organisations.</p>
<p>The team should collaborate in identifying individuals and organisations within the FOSS community, renowned speakers, and experts from diverse fields such as design, science, government, education, policy, and public good sectors also ensuring diversity in terms of gender, regional representation, and expertise. A balanced approach helps showcase different voices and experiences. Clear internal communication protocols are essential to manage outreach efforts efficiently and avoid duplicating tasks.</p>
<h2 id="reaching-out-to-the-community-for-referrals"><a class="header" href="#reaching-out-to-the-community-for-referrals">Reaching out to the community for referrals</a></h2>
<p>A key task is identifying speakers who can bring diverse perspectives. This includes looking beyond the typical names and encouraging new voices, especially from marginalized communities.</p>
<p>It’s important to tap into the existing network for speaker recommendations. Previous speakers, community members, or peers from similar conferences often have valuable suggestions. This is a quick and effective way to get in touch with experienced speakers who already have a relationship with the community.</p>
<p>Divide outreach work within the group. Regularly reach out to past speakers and ask them to refer new potential speakers. Personalized outreach often yields better results. Maintaining these connections can help create a steady flow of diverse speakers.</p>
<h2 id="sourcing-speakers-from-the-foss-community"><a class="header" href="#sourcing-speakers-from-the-foss-community">Sourcing speakers from the FOSS community</a></h2>
<p>One of the core responsibilities of the workgroup is to source speakers who are active in the FOSS space. These speakers can come from within the community or be referred to by others. It’s important to ensure that the speakers selected bring a mix of technical and non-technical perspectives to the event.</p>
<p>Focus: When selecting speakers, prioritize those who have demonstrated meaningful contributions to FOSS or have a background in FOSS space. This helps ensure that the content delivered at the event is relevant and aligned with the core values of the community.</p>
<h2 id="managing-diversity-scholarships"><a class="header" href="#managing-diversity-scholarships">Managing diversity scholarships</a></h2>
<p>The diversity scholarship program is designed to support individuals from underrepresented communities who are interested in attending the event. When managing this program, it’s important to prioritise candidates who already have some exposure to FOSS. These individuals are more likely to benefit from the event and make meaningful connections with the community. Reaching out to organisations and individuals that work with gender minorities, women, and communities from tier 2 and tier 3 cities can significantly enhance the diversity of attendees. This can be done by contacting organisations that have a track record of advocating for these groups or by soliciting referrals from within the community.</p>
<p><strong>Selection:</strong> Make sure to have clear criteria for the scholarship, prioritizing those who demonstrate interest in FOSS. Candidates who can articulate how the event would benefit their FOSS journey should be given special attention. Organise a transparent and efficient system for processing applications and communicating results.Connect with educational institutions, NGOs, and community organisations. Keep a clear system for sorting applications and a proper sheet with all the details of approached organisations to avoid multiple approaches. Build relationships with these organisations early in the planning process. They can often provide access to potential scholars and participants who are not yet deeply involved in FOSS but are keen to learn. Use their networks to promote the event and scholarship opportunities to ensure a broad and inclusive reach.</p>
<h2 id="maintaining-longterm-relationships-with-diversity-scholars-speakers"><a class="header" href="#maintaining-longterm-relationships-with-diversity-scholars-speakers">Maintaining longterm relationships with Diversity Scholars/ speakers</a></h2>
<p>After the event, it is important to maintain contact with diversity scholars/speakers. They can help amplify the work of the community within their own network, whether at their schools, colleges, or workplaces. Keeping them engaged in the community beyond the event also increases the chances that they will return as future participants, volunteers, or speakers.</p>
<p><strong>Post-event:</strong> Send follow-up emails and maintain communication with past scholars. Encourage them to share their experiences and spread the word about the event in their local communities. This can be an effective way of expanding outreach for future editions of the event.</p>
<h2 id="providing-support-to-speakers-and-diversity-scholars"><a class="header" href="#providing-support-to-speakers-and-diversity-scholars">Providing support to speakers and diversity scholars</a></h2>
<p>Supporting speakers and scholars is key to ensuring their experience is positive and enriching. This involves clear communication before the event, addressing their logistical needs (like travel and accommodation), and offering any resources or assistance required during the event itself. Make sure to send detailed instructions to speakers and scholars well in advance, covering everything from the schedule to logistical arrangements. It’s important to establish a point of contact for any queries or issues they may have, ensuring they feel supported throughout the process. Regular check-ins, either via email or phone, can help smooth out any issues before they become problems.</p>
<h2 id="ensuring-accessibility-and-inclusivity-for-all"><a class="header" href="#ensuring-accessibility-and-inclusivity-for-all">Ensuring accessibility and inclusivity for all</a></h2>
<p>It’s essential to make the event accessible and inclusive for everyone, including differently abled attendees. This includes ensuring that the venue is accessible (ramps, elevators, etc.), providing sign language interpreters if needed, and offering any other necessary accommodations. Rooms for people to just relax if they feel overstimulated during the conference and need some time to relax and should also be communicated well in advance.</p>
<p>Mothers attending the event with infants or young children require special accommodations. These may include setting up a designated area for breastfeeding or offering childcare services to help them fully participate in the event. If possible, provide on-site childcare services or information on nearby childcare facilities. Communicate these options well in advance to mothers so they can plan accordingly.</p>
<p>Include a section in the registration form where attendees can specify any accessibility needs, dietary restrictions, or other accommodations. Once these needs are identified, work closely with the relevant teams to ensure all requirements are met, whether it’s providing transportation assistance, dietary accommodations, or support for individuals with sensory sensitivities.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration-with-other-volunteers"><a class="header" href="#collaboration-with-other-volunteers">Collaboration with other volunteers</a></h2>
<p>Collaboration between different workgroups (like content or logistics) is vital to ensure smooth functioning. Proper social media marketing should be done for both diverse speakers and diversity scholarship. Delegating tasks and ensuring everyone understands their roles can make the workload manageable and less overwhelming. Have clear internal communication protocols in place. Holding regular check-ins can help avoid overlap and keep work balanced among members. Hold regular inter-workgroup meetings to sync efforts, ensuring that diversity and inclusion considerations are embedded into every aspect of the event, from content to logistics.</p>
<h2 id="feedback-from-the-participants-speakers-and-scholars"><a class="header" href="#feedback-from-the-participants-speakers-and-scholars">Feedback from the participants, speakers, and scholars</a></h2>
<p>Implement a feedback system where speakers and scholars can share their experiences. This helps identify any gaps in support or areas where the diversity workgroup could improve. Send post-event feedback form to speakers and scholars asking for input on the event’s inclusivity efforts. Use this feedback to refine the outreach and selection processes.</p>

<h2 id="indiafoss-emceeing-responsibilities"><a class="header" href="#indiafoss-emceeing-responsibilities">IndiaFOSS Emcee’ing Responsibilities</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are typically two emcees per auditorium and they can collectively figure out how they want to present, one way is to take turns alternating emcee’s for speakers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After deciding which Speakers you’ll be introducing as the Emcee, ideally prepare what you’re going to say beforehand and have the “script” printed out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Speaker response sheet which includes their bio and talk description in the way the speaker themselves would like to state them is usually the key reference while preparing the emcee script. An additional reference is the content team’s captions for the social media posts 😄.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you know the password for the wifi, the FOSS United provisioned laptops which the speakers present from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you get to know the Audi logistics volunteer who will be there to overlook and help out in case of last-minute technical challenges and that you have their contact information, (phone numbers are definitely more convenient than having their telegram since in some cases people can have their telegram-call-reception switched off).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure the speaker for the next talk is present atleast 20 minutes before the current talk ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a quick word with the next speaker going over how they will be presenting and in case they have any special requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Announcements promoting other activities that will be starting / going on in other parts of the conference. Sometimes speakers also have a Birds-of-Feather session or a booth in place which can be promoted uness they don’t shout them out themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is oddly specific but sometimes the wifi doesn’t work and you have to resort to personal hotspot. Make sure your phone has enough battery or the battery-saving modes don’t interfere!</p>
