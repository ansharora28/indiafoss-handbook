# Registration desk

The resgistration desk volunteers are responsible for making sure all the participants get checked in and to ensure food and goodies are provided to the participants. The registration desk also acts as the first point of contact for the participants/speakers, and as a help desk later during the conference. People might be confused and or might be unfamilar to the conference, here the registration desk clear all the doubts and queries the pariticipans or speakers may have.
