This purpose of this handbook is to familiarize everyone with all that happens behind the scenes at the conference. All the volunteers and organizers are encourage to go through this documentation and update it whenever necessary.

The event happens tentatively in September-October every year at NIMHANS convention center, Bengaluru. As of last year, we saw 1600+ registrations (and 1300+ attendees in person), 44 talks, 7 workshops, 8 BoF sessions and 14 on spot lightning talks at the conference.

The event has a unconference flair to it which offers attendees to either participate in the typical conference setup with talks happening in auditoriums (3) or be a part of the various activities that happen parallely. This includes project expos, Birds of a Feather Sessions, Open Spaces, Lightning Talks etc.
